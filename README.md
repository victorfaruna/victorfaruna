## Hi, I'm Faruna

## Focus

I prioritize building production-grade systems at the intersection of:

- Fintech architecture  
- Blockchain infrastructure  
- Scalable backend systems  
- High-performance web & mobile applications  

My work centers around building foundational layers, not surface features.
